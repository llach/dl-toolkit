# Variational Autoencoder

This is a basic implemantation of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Weighting the Kullback-Leibler-Divergence
with the hyperparameter beta is possible. Disentangled latent space representations may be achieved by
carefully choosing the correct beta for the task. Selecting the correct beta is described in one of the 
Higgins et. al. papers.
